# Heaps_Console_Application

# Introduction:

_This Java console application utilizes a heap structure (Priority Queue) to manage and organize meetings. Meetings are prioritized based on their start time, ensuring the earliest meetings are scheduled first._

# What It Can Do:
1. **Add Meetings**: _Users can input meeting details, including a title, date, and start time._
2. **View All Scheduled Meetings**: _Lists all meetings sorted by the nearest start time._
3. **Retrieve Next Meeting**: _Displays and removes the meeting scheduled to occur next._
4. **Exit**: _Exits the application._

# Why I Made This Application and How does it contribute to you and to your community:

  _Scheduling is a common real-world problem that can benefit from efficient data structures.This project provides a hands-on example of how to use heaps in event scheduling. It serves as a learning resource for students and developers exploring data structures and real-world applications._
